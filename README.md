I have designed a website called <b>AHIN Hotels</b>, that displays information on eight different hotels in the AHIN Hotels chain. <b>The main page of the website contains eight cards, with each card providing information on a specific hotel in the chain,</b>. The information provided in a card is as follows:
<ol>
<li>The first section of the card gives the "<b>Latest Statistics</b>" on that specific hotel. The number of Ocuppied Rooms, the Free Rooms, and the Total Rooms are displayed at a glance.
<li>The second part of the card displays the "<b>Finances</b>" of that specific hotel. The Average Salary per Staff per Hour, the hotel's Total Profit and Total Expenses are shown.</li>
<li>Finally, the last section in the card called "<b>View Reservations</b>" provides statistics on the hotel's rooms. Upon entering the room number, the Name of the Guest, and the Room Type is displayed.</li>
